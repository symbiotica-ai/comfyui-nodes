# Roadmap

Ideas queued for the pack. One block per idea, numbered by its GitHub issue —
refer to an entry as #N. Move a block to the CHANGELOG when it ships.

## [#71](https://github.com/symbiotica-ai/comfyui-nodes/issues/71) — Approved assets go back into the dataset

An approved render should land back in the project's `dataset/` under its
category and asset name, so it can be picked as the base for a future
generation — this month's approved crate becomes next month's reference.

- Today the approve lane stops at the save path; `dataset/<Category>/` is
  seeded by hand and never learns what was accepted.
- Once it does, `Dataset Reference` and `Pick Similar Asset From Project` offer
  approved work like any seeded reference, and the style loop is closed.
- Open: copy or reference in place; write from the Pick node at approve time or
  from its own node in the lane; what a re-approval does to the earlier version.

## [#66](https://github.com/symbiotica-ai/comfyui-nodes/issues/66) — Render lane: use / don't use reference image

Generate with or without a client reference. The architect chat's `image`
comes from the Pick Client Reference node; an asset with no client refs (or a
deliberately empty pick) should still compose and render — a use/don't-use
switch, or an empty pick simply meaning "no reference".

## [#67](https://github.com/symbiotica-ai/comfyui-nodes/issues/67) — Preload models at workflow start

Load the diffusion model, VAE, controlnets, CLIP and loras at workflow start
instead of at first queue — the GPU is paid for whether it renders or not, so
warm it while the user is still picking assets and writing prompts. First
generation should not carry the cold-load penalty.
