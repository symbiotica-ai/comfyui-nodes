# Changelog

Versions are `YYYY.M.BUILD` — the year, the month, and a build number that
restarts each month. Releases through `2.43.0` used semantic versioning.

Because the version no longer encodes compatibility, any release that changes a
node's inputs, outputs, or id says so at the top of its entry.

## 2026.7.16

### Fixed
- **Order Specs "📁 Read folder" button no longer disappears on a fresh Comfy
  start.** It's a DOM widget that was flagged `hideOnZoom`, so ComfyUI hid it
  (like the other DOM widgets) whenever the canvas was below the zoom threshold —
  it looked missing at a normal working zoom. It now always renders.

## 2026.7.15

A browse-time fix for wired Studio Library paths. No node's inputs, outputs, or
ids changed — nothing here breaks an existing workflow.

### Fixed
- **Wiring `project_path` from the Symbiotica Studio Library node now fills the
  Order Specs pickers.** The wire carries the node's volume-relative selection
  (`studios/<slug>/...`), which the browse routes' directory checks rejected —
  "Read folder" and the month/feature dropdowns came up empty while execute-time
  rendering worked. The `list-orders`, `parse-order`, `list-assets`, and
  `pack-template-list` routes now resolve that form to its absolute path through
  the Studio Library's confinement resolver; any other path behaves as before.

## 2026.7.14

### Fixed
- **Auto Packer `border` and `padding` now work.** They were ignored by the
  packer's layout (hardcoded 0 cell gap, no box drawn). Now `padding` is the gap
  between a region's cells (an asset and its mirror) as well as between packed
  strips, and `border` draws a frame that many px thick around **each icon cell**
  — the asset and its mirror each get a box ("icon inside a box"), in a color
  that contrasts the sheet background. `border = 0` = no box.

## 2026.7.13

### Fixed
- **Template Library `sheets`/`sheet_prompts` no longer crash a downstream
  Preview / Show Text when nothing is checked.** An empty output list made
  ComfyUI do `v[-1]` on `[]` → `IndexError`. Now the outputs fall back to the
  `use`-selected template when no box is ticked, and never emit an empty list
  (a small placeholder tile + hint prompt when nothing is checked or selected).

## 2026.7.12

Per-size Auto Packer scaling. **Input change:** the Auto Packer Settings node's
`scale` and `scale_max_canvas` widgets are replaced by `scale_target` +
`scale_max` (a stale saved value resets to default; no outputs or ids changed).

### Changed
- **Scaling is now per-size.** Each sprite grows so its longest canvas edge
  reaches ~`scale_target` px, capped at `scale_max`× and never below 1× (never
  shrinks). So `target 512, max 3×` gives a 128 sprite ×3 (capped), a 256 ×2, a
  512 native — small sprites scale more than large ones, and the cap keeps a
  scaled sheet from overflowing. Replaces the old single flat `scale` +
  `scale_max_canvas` cutoff, which scaled every sub-cutoff size by the same
  factor. `scale_target = off` disables scaling; `fit width` is unchanged.

## 2026.7.11

Template Library now carries settings on load and can output saved sheets
directly. **Input/output change (backward compatible):** the Template Library
node gains a `checked` input and two outputs (`sheets`, `sheet_prompts`); the
existing `template` output is unchanged (still slot 0).

### Added
- **Template Library → `sheets` / `sheet_prompts` outputs** + a per-row
  checkbox. Check any templates to stream their *saved* sheets and client
  prompts straight out — no re-render through the Auto Packer. Prompts are now
  stored in `template.json` at save time (older templates emit empty prompts
  until re-saved).
- **Selecting a template now loads its Model Preset + Pack Settings** onto the
  Auto Packer's wired Preset / Settings nodes (reverse-mapped from the saved
  recipe), so those nodes show — and the pack uses — the values the template was
  saved with. Previously a wired Settings node silently overrode the template.

## 2026.7.10

Auto Packer combined/split variant fixes. **Output/naming change:** combined
variant sheets are named differently (see below); no node inputs/outputs/ids
changed.

### Fixed
- **Combined sheets** no longer split a single directional asset's references
  across separate `-v1`/`-v2` sheets. Every reference becomes its own mirror-pair
  region, and a `(category, canvas)` group's regions now paginate by
  `max_rows_per_sheet` — so an asset's refs stay together on one sheet when they
  fit (e.g. a 256 decoration with 2 refs → one combined sheet, both refs). This
  renames combined variant sheets from `<base>-<cat>-v<k>` to
  `<base>-<cat>[-<canvas>][-<page>]`.
- **Split variants** now emits a sheet for a *single-reference* directional
  asset too (its one ref + horizontal flip), not only 2+ ref assets — so every
  directional item gets its per-item ref+flip sheet.

## 2026.7.9

Template Library — save an Auto Packer setup once and reload it after a restart.
**Input change (backward compatible):** the Auto Packer gains an optional
`template` input, a `save_as` field, and its `order` input is now optional;
existing workflows keep working (order still drives it when wired).

### Added
- **Symbiotica Template Library** (new node) — browses a project's saved Auto
  Packer templates as folders with sheet thumbnails and outputs one as a
  `SYMBIOTICA_PACK_TEMPLATE` recipe (frozen order + model preset + pack settings
  + category + per-asset overrides). Wire it into the Auto Packer's `template`
  input to re-pack or edit a saved setup without rebuilding the chain.
- **Auto Packer → "Save as template"** button — writes this run's sheets plus
  the effective recipe to `<project>/templates/<name>/` (sheet PNGs +
  `template.json` together). Falls back to `output/templates/` when the project
  folder is unwritable (read-only Modal Volume) or unset; the Library browses
  both.
- `/symbiotica/pack-template-list` and `/symbiotica/pack-template-delete` routes.

### Changed
- **Symbiotica Order Specs** — the `order` wire now also carries `project_path`
  and `month` (additive) so a template save can reproduce the exact event.
- The Auto Packer `category` default is now empty (the "unset" sentinel that
  defers to a wired template); an explicit "All" is honored as "pack every
  type". A fresh node still shows "All".

## 2026.7.8

Studio Library browser UI polish. No node's inputs, outputs, or ids changed —
nothing here breaks an existing workflow.

### Changed
- **Symbiotica Studio Library** browser is now a centered ~80% modal over a
  dimmed, click-to-close backdrop (was fullscreen), restyled against the
  symbiotica hub design tokens. Clicking a folder row opens it (files select).
- A shared `web/js/hub_theme.js` module now holds the pack's base palette and
  interaction styles for web extensions to build on.

## 2026.7.7

Adds a new node. No existing node's inputs, outputs, or ids changed —
nothing here breaks an existing workflow.

### Added
- **Symbiotica Studio Library** — a single-select browser (with a
  client-side name filter) for the active studio's non-model asset tree —
  reference images, arbitrary files, and folder paths — emitting an absolute
  sandbox path plus `is_dir` for downstream path-consuming nodes. Model
  kinds stay hidden (already native via `/comfy-models`).

## 2026.7.3

Two fixes for the hosted (Modal) canvas and the Prompt Tuner. No node's
inputs, outputs, or ids changed — nothing here breaks an existing workflow.

### Fixes

- **Order Specs works on the hosted canvas when `project_path` is wired.**
  Feeding the path in over a wire (a Local/Modal switch) instead of typing it
  now populates the month and feature dropdowns and loads the Auto Packer
  thumbnails — no more wiring a packer to a Preview and queueing just to fill
  the pickers. A new "📁 Read folder" button on Order Specs resolves the path,
  fills the pickers, and registers the reference root on demand. A wired path
  only ever fills the dropdowns; it never overwrites the month or feature you
  picked, so routing `project_path` through a switch can't silently render the
  wrong order.
- **NS Prompt Tuner no longer records a stray refinement after an interrupted
  queue.** Cancelling a run mid-loop could leave a pending serve that the next
  pinned Load counted as one spurious refinement; the stall guard now abandons
  that pending serve when it halts.

## 2026.7.2

Adds three new nodes (**Symbiotica Files Read**, **NS Prompt Tuner Load**,
**NS Prompt Tuner Save**). No existing node's inputs, outputs, or ids changed —
nothing here breaks an existing workflow.

### Added

- **Symbiotica Files Read** builds template sheets from loose client reference
  folders, without a monthly order spreadsheet. Its face is a reference folder,
  a base name, and a files-browser button; it emits the same `order` wire as
  Order Specs, so it feeds the existing Auto Packer, Model Preset, and Auto
  Packer Settings nodes unchanged. In the browser a folder becomes one sheet
  row and the files you tick become its cells, with a name search and
  pixel-size filters for grouping similar images.
- Nested reference paths now resolve for any sheet draw (a shared exact-rel
  then basename rule), and a new `/symbiotica/ref-image` route makes the canvas
  preview match the queued sheet. Existing spreadsheet orders are unaffected.
- **NS Prompt Tuner Load / NS Prompt Tuner Save — a self-improving
  system-prompt loop.** Each queue run serves the current best system prompt,
  generates, has a refiner LLM critique the result against a design reference,
  and saves the refined prompt as the next version; Auto-Queue iterates
  hands-free. The per-`tuner_id` state file keeps every version and critique,
  the refiner sees the full history plus the user's rough guidance, and the
  loop halts itself on convergence or `max_iterations`. `version_override`
  pins a version for production: recording stops and repeat runs cache fully.
  Malformed or truncated refiner replies are rejected rather than saved. See
  `docs/prompt-tuner.md`.
- **Cancel works on hosted video jobs.** Interrupting a run now actually stops
  Wavespeed and Grok video jobs instead of letting them bill to completion.

### Fixes

- **The tuner cannot re-bill a stalled loop.** A muted or unwired Save node
  used to leave the loop generating (and paying) every queue with no progress;
  it now halts after three unrecorded serves and says which node to fix. Two
  pinned Loads sharing a `tuner_id` no longer churn the state file and re-run
  both branches every queue.
- **NS Music and NS Sound Effects no longer store the ElevenLabs key in the
  workflow**, and the pack reads the Settings-UI keys it already asks users
  for. Workflows stay shareable without leaking credentials.

### Other

- Registry publishing hardened: the publish fires on the release itself, and
  release notes land in the registry changelog automatically.

## 2026.7.1

First release using calendar versions. No node inputs, outputs, or ids changed —
nothing here breaks an existing workflow.

### Fixes

- **Order Specs no longer floods the server with order parses.** The Auto
  Packer's assets panel and its category combo both asked for the order while
  rendering, and the answer they got sent them round again — a request per round
  trip per packer, multiplying with each packer wired up. Worst measured case
  went from 942 requests to 1. A parse that fails is remembered rather than
  retried on sight; a rate limit or server error backs off; wiring the node or
  editing project, month, or feature asks again.

### Other

- The node UI has tests now: `tests/js/`, on node's own runner, no dependency
  added. They drive the shipped `web/js` files through a ComfyUI stub.
- Release process written down in `.claude/release/`, and this changelog.
