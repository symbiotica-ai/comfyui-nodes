# Changelog

Versions are `YYYY.M.BUILD` — the year, the month, and a build number that
restarts each month. Releases through `2.43.0` used semantic versioning.

Because the version no longer encodes compatibility, any release that changes a
node's inputs, outputs, or id says so at the top of its entry.

## 2026.7.1

First release using calendar versions. No node inputs, outputs, or ids changed —
nothing here breaks an existing workflow.

### Fixes

- **Order Specs no longer floods the server with order parses.** The Auto
  Packer's assets panel and its category combo both asked for the order while
  rendering, and the answer they got sent them round again — a request per round
  trip per packer, multiplying with each packer wired up. Worst measured case
  went from 942 requests to 1. A parse that fails is remembered rather than
  retried on sight; a rate limit or server error backs off; wiring the node or
  editing project, month, or feature asks again.

### Other

- The node UI has tests now: `tests/js/`, on node's own runner, no dependency
  added. They drive the shipped `web/js` files through a ComfyUI stub.
- Release process written down in `.claude/release/`, and this changelog.
