# Changelog

Versions are `YYYY.M.BUILD` — the year, the month, and a build number that
restarts each month. Releases through `2.43.0` used semantic versioning.

Because the version no longer encodes compatibility, any release that changes a
node's inputs, outputs, or id says so at the top of its entry.

## 2026.7.7

Adds a new node. No existing node's inputs, outputs, or ids changed —
nothing here breaks an existing workflow.

### Added
- **Symbiotica Studio Library** — a single-select browser (with a
  client-side name filter) for the active studio's non-model asset tree —
  reference images, arbitrary files, and folder paths — emitting an absolute
  sandbox path plus `is_dir` for downstream path-consuming nodes. Model
  kinds stay hidden (already native via `/comfy-models`).

## 2026.7.3

Two fixes for the hosted (Modal) canvas and the Prompt Tuner. No node's
inputs, outputs, or ids changed — nothing here breaks an existing workflow.

### Fixes

- **Order Specs works on the hosted canvas when `project_path` is wired.**
  Feeding the path in over a wire (a Local/Modal switch) instead of typing it
  now populates the month and feature dropdowns and loads the Auto Packer
  thumbnails — no more wiring a packer to a Preview and queueing just to fill
  the pickers. A new "📁 Read folder" button on Order Specs resolves the path,
  fills the pickers, and registers the reference root on demand. A wired path
  only ever fills the dropdowns; it never overwrites the month or feature you
  picked, so routing `project_path` through a switch can't silently render the
  wrong order.
- **NS Prompt Tuner no longer records a stray refinement after an interrupted
  queue.** Cancelling a run mid-loop could leave a pending serve that the next
  pinned Load counted as one spurious refinement; the stall guard now abandons
  that pending serve when it halts.

## 2026.7.2

Adds three new nodes (**Symbiotica Files Read**, **NS Prompt Tuner Load**,
**NS Prompt Tuner Save**). No existing node's inputs, outputs, or ids changed —
nothing here breaks an existing workflow.

### Added

- **Symbiotica Files Read** builds template sheets from loose client reference
  folders, without a monthly order spreadsheet. Its face is a reference folder,
  a base name, and a files-browser button; it emits the same `order` wire as
  Order Specs, so it feeds the existing Auto Packer, Model Preset, and Auto
  Packer Settings nodes unchanged. In the browser a folder becomes one sheet
  row and the files you tick become its cells, with a name search and
  pixel-size filters for grouping similar images.
- Nested reference paths now resolve for any sheet draw (a shared exact-rel
  then basename rule), and a new `/symbiotica/ref-image` route makes the canvas
  preview match the queued sheet. Existing spreadsheet orders are unaffected.
- **NS Prompt Tuner Load / NS Prompt Tuner Save — a self-improving
  system-prompt loop.** Each queue run serves the current best system prompt,
  generates, has a refiner LLM critique the result against a design reference,
  and saves the refined prompt as the next version; Auto-Queue iterates
  hands-free. The per-`tuner_id` state file keeps every version and critique,
  the refiner sees the full history plus the user's rough guidance, and the
  loop halts itself on convergence or `max_iterations`. `version_override`
  pins a version for production: recording stops and repeat runs cache fully.
  Malformed or truncated refiner replies are rejected rather than saved. See
  `docs/prompt-tuner.md`.
- **Cancel works on hosted video jobs.** Interrupting a run now actually stops
  Wavespeed and Grok video jobs instead of letting them bill to completion.

### Fixes

- **The tuner cannot re-bill a stalled loop.** A muted or unwired Save node
  used to leave the loop generating (and paying) every queue with no progress;
  it now halts after three unrecorded serves and says which node to fix. Two
  pinned Loads sharing a `tuner_id` no longer churn the state file and re-run
  both branches every queue.
- **NS Music and NS Sound Effects no longer store the ElevenLabs key in the
  workflow**, and the pack reads the Settings-UI keys it already asks users
  for. Workflows stay shareable without leaking credentials.

### Other

- Registry publishing hardened: the publish fires on the release itself, and
  release notes land in the registry changelog automatically.

## 2026.7.1

First release using calendar versions. No node inputs, outputs, or ids changed —
nothing here breaks an existing workflow.

### Fixes

- **Order Specs no longer floods the server with order parses.** The Auto
  Packer's assets panel and its category combo both asked for the order while
  rendering, and the answer they got sent them round again — a request per round
  trip per packer, multiplying with each packer wired up. Worst measured case
  went from 942 requests to 1. A parse that fails is remembered rather than
  retried on sight; a rate limit or server error backs off; wiring the node or
  editing project, month, or feature asks again.

### Other

- The node UI has tests now: `tests/js/`, on node's own runner, no dependency
  added. They drive the shipped `web/js` files through a ComfyUI stub.
- Release process written down in `.claude/release/`, and this changelog.
